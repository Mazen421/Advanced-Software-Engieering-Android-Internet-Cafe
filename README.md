# **!! IMPORTANT !! This is an Android app designed using Java on Android Studio Gradle**

# About

This app was designed as part of a college project, it's purpose was to serve as a building block for diagrams and designs related to software engineering, Despite that the app is **functional** and can be used

## Back-End

The back-end was developed entirely by Ahmed, it was done in Java using classes and Object Oriented Patterns to maintain the hierarchy and functionality

## Front-End

The front-end was developed entirely by Mazen, it was done in Android studio using XML and fragments, It utilizes features packed in Android Studio and also custom made features to fit the usage of the app

## Software Engineering

We have created full documentation about the design of our program including use cases, CRC, Swimlane and ...etc, it's purpose is to explain how the app functions and how the classes interact with each other and the front-end
# Progression

- The back end is fully finished
- The front end is not fully finished, it is 75% done
- All of the software engineering parts are fully finished
